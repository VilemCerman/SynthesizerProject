# SynthesizerProject
This is my WinForms synthesizer for my school project</br>
All you need is to start the program and play with your keyboard. You can add or remove more oscillators and individualy change their pitch and volume. I haven't add an overall volume controll yet, but maybe in the future(?)... Also you can't play more notes at once.</br>
